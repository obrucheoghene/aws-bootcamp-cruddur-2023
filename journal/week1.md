# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Required Homework

### 1. Containerize Application (Dockerfiles, Docker Compose)
Here are the steps I took to containerize the Cruddur application.

#### Backend Containization
- Created a `Dockerfile` in `backend-flask` directory

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

WORKDIR /backend-flask

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

ENV FLASK_ENV=development

EXPOSE ${PORT}
CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"]
```

### 2. Document the Notification Endpoint for the OpenAI Document
