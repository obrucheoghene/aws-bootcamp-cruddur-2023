# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

### Definintion
Decentralized authentication refers to an authentication process that is based on decentralized systems and technologies. In traditional centralized authentication, users must provide their credentials (such as usernames and passwords) to a central authority (such as a server or service) for verification. This central authority is responsible for managing user authentication and authorizing access to resources.

In contrast, decentralized authentication is based on distributed systems and technologies that allow users to authenticate themselves without relying on a central authority. Instead, authentication is based on cryptographic methods, such as public key cryptography and digital signatures, that provide secure and verifiable authentication without the need for a central authority.
