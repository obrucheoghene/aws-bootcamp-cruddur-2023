# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

### How it started

I started out following the videos by Shala Warner (@giftedLane) to create free accounts on tools and 
application required for the bootcamp.

Here is a list of the accounts created

- **Amazon Web Services:**
    Amazon Web Services(AWS) is a cloud based service that provides on demand cloud computing and APIs to individuals, companies and government

- **Github:** 
    Github is an internet hosting service for software development and version control using git.

- **Gitpod:**
    Gitpod is an open source developer platform automating the provisioning of ready-to-code developer environments

- **LucidChart:**
    Lucidchart is used to sketch and share professional flowchart diagrams and architecture. 

- **Honeycomb:**
    Honeycomb helps you observer and analyze application to discover issues.

- **Rollbar:**
    Rollbar can help you discover and fix errors faster across your development pipeline by uncovering and resolving them in real-time, before users complain.

### Learning Point

Types of Architecture Design
- Conceptual Design
- Logical Design
- Physical Design

**Difference**
A conceptual Design is the highest level, and therefore the least detailed. A logical Design involves more detailed thinking about the implementation without actually implementing anything. Finally, the physical Design draws on the requirements from the logical Design to create a real database.
