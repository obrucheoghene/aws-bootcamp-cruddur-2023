## Required Homework

### Recreate Conceptual Diagram
I created my conceptual diagram on lucid chart. It was my first time to use lucid chart so I watched a tutorial on youtube which helped me to use it properly.

### How it started

I started out following the videos by Shala Warner (@giftedLane) to create free accounts on tools and 
application required for the bootcamp.

Here is a list of the accounts created

### Learning Point

Types of Architecture Design
- Conceptual Design
- Logical Design
- Physical Design

**Difference**
A conceptual Design is the highest level, and therefore the least detailed. A logical Design involves more detailed thinking about the implementation without actually implementing anything. Finally, the physical Design draws on the requirements from the logical Design to create a real database.
