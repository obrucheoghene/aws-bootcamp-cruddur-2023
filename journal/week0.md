### Learning Point

Types of Architecture Design
- Conceptual Design
- Logical Design
- Physical Design

**Difference**
A conceptual Design is the highest level, and therefore the least detailed. A logical Design involves more detailed thinking about the implementation without actually implementing anything. Finally, the physical Design draws on the requirements from the logical Design to create a real database.
